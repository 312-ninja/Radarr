How strict the Parser should be. (Note: Strict is strongly recommended!)
<br><br>
<b>Strict:</b> Just as before, year must immediately follow title.
<br><br>
<b>Lenient Parsing:</b> Either year or language tag must immediately follow after title. (Note: May prevent Movies with language tags in title - e.g. The Danish Girl - from being parsed correctly)
<br><br>
<b>Lenient Mapping:</b> Includes Lenient Parsing. When title cannot be found Try mapping just parts of the title. (Useful when no year is present / not after title. <b>NOT IMPLEMENTED YET</b>)
